## Introduction
LangChain simplifies the process of building applications powered by LLMs by providing tools for chaining multiple tasks, managing memory, and integrating external data sources. It is designed for tasks such as:
- **Text summarisation**
- **Question answering**
- **Conversational agents**
- **Data retrieval**

## Installation
To start using LangChain, install the library using pip:
```bash
pip install langchain
```
Make sure you also have access to an LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI API, Hugging Face, or other models).

## Core Concepts

### Chains
Chains are sequences of operations that process input and produce output. LangChain provides pre-built chains and allows you to build custom ones.
```python
from langchain.chains import SimpleChain
# Example code to create a simple chain.
```

### Memory
Memory enables LangChain to retain context between interactions, making it suitable for conversational agents.
```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationMemory
# Example code to use conversation memory.
```

### Agents
Agents dynamically decide which actions to take (e.g., calling APIs, searching databases) based on user input and context.
```python
from langchain.agents import ToolAgent
# Example code to create an agent.
```

### Indexes
Indexes help with retrieving and managing large datasets for tasks like search or summarisation.
```python
from langchain.indexes import VectorStoreIndex
# Example code for working with indexes.
```

## Getting Started
Here is a basic example of using LangChain to create a simple chain:
```python
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# Define a prompt template
prompt = PromptTemplate(template="What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?", input_variables=["product"])

# Initialize the LLM
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7)

# Create the chain
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

# Run the chain
print(chain.run(product="smartphones"))
```

## Examples
1. **Conversational Agent:** Build a chatbot that remembers context between interactions.
2. **Text Summarisation:** Summarise large documents or multiple articles.
3. **Dynamic Task Chains:** Create workflows that adapt based on user input.

## Advanced Topics
- **Customising Prompts:** Fine-tune prompts to enhance model performance.
- **Integrating with APIs:** Use LangChain to dynamically fetch and process data from APIs.
- **Advanced Memory Management:** Leverage tools like long-term memory storage.
